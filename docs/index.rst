Welcome to proteovae's documentation!
=====================================
This package aims at providing a consistent set of tools for implementing multi-task objective variational autoencoders.  
It was originally developed for uses in genomics data (hence the name *proteo[mics]*-vae).

objective will be available, as well as a cleaner embedding method for VAE objects.
